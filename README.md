# Microsoft-Excel---Maven-Marketing-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard

Data cleaning and analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel. I opened the 'marketing_data(Raw).csv' file in Power Query and converted the data into a table. I also created a column called Total Sales by adding together the sales items of the individual products. 

I then performed my data analysis by creating Pivot tables and charts and putting together all the information obtained into one interactive dashboard. The following business questions had to be addressed:

1) Which marketing campaign was the most successful?
2) Which products are performing best?
3) Which channels are underperforming?
4) What factors are significantly related to the number of web purchases?
5) Does the education level of customers have an effect on sales?
6) Which country had the best sales?

# Observations

- Marketing campaigns 1,3,4 and 5 were all successull, however campaign 5 was the most successful campaign while campaign 3 was not successful as it had the least amount of interactions.
- The company's best-performing product is wine which contributed 50.17% towards total sales. Sweets and Fruits are the worst-performing projects and contribute a combined total of 8.81% towards sales.
- The sales channels that are not performing well are Deals and Catalogues while Store and Web sales are high. The conversion rate between web visits and web purchases is 76.83% which is very good.
- Factors that are significantly related to the number of web purchases are Education and Marital Status, from the above chart it is evident that married couples contributed to the highest amount of sales with couples that stay together in second place. It is evident that single people do not purchase as much as what might be considered family structures. Singles, divorced and all categories of people that stay alone should be targeted by the company to further improve sales. 
The education level of customers also significantly relates to the number of web visits with customers who have graduated and those with some form of post-graduation qualification accounting for more than 70% toward web visits.
- The education level of customers has an effect on sales as customers in this group earn significantly more income than customers that have not graduated and therefore have more disposable income to spend.
- Spain is the best-performing country when it comes to sales done, 48.8% of total sales come from Spain with Saudi Arabia coming in second. Mexico has really low sales figures and this can be viewed as an opportunity to increase and expand in the country. The low sales could be caused by the fact that customers are not aware of our presence in the country because of the few stores we have.

  # Recommendations

- I recommend that the company should drop campaign 3 and focus on drawing attention to the campaigns that are performing well. The following campaigns can be introduced to improve sales:
  1) Campaign target at improving Catalogue and Deals channels to make them more visible to customers
  2) Campaign target at improving sales in Mexico which run across social media and digital media to make our presence in the country 
     more visible as the low amount of sales could be attributed to customers not being aware that the company operates in their country.
  3) To further improve sales the company should launch a new campaign targeted at promoting healthy eating which will lead to increased 
     sales of fruit and fish products. One way of doing this is by having specials on specified days where customers get significant 
     discounts if they purchase these products.
- There is a high conversion rate of web visits to web purchases, to further improve this I recommend that the company should introduce a system that tracks customer web visits and reminds customers to complete their purchases if they have items in the cart that still need to be checked out.
